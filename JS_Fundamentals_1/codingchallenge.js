/*
Coding Challenge 1:
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/*
Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console,saying who has the higherB MI.The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ 
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
